  <p>The following are some of the suggested references for the topics covered in the course. For each lecture, the releveant reading materials will be from one or more of the following books.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Oppenheim, Alan V., Ronald W. Schafer, and John R. Buck. Discrete-time signal processing. Vol. 2. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-hall, 1989.</li>
    <li>Proakis John, G., and G. Manolakis Dimitris. Digital Signal Processing, principles, algorithms, and applications. Pentice Hall, 1996.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A more advanced book that goes into the mathematical foundations of signal processing, which also gives geometric view of signal processing is the book,</p>
