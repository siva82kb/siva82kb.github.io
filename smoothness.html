          Supplementary material for the modified spectral arc length (SAL) metric paper:
        </h2>
        <p>This page contains the supplementary material for the modified SAL, which was developed to solve the issue associatedw with the original SAL published in <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104119&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6104119">earlier</a>. The validation of the modified SAL was done using simulated movement data generated as a sum of individual submovement of same amplitude, duration and inter-submovement interval. This is the same analysis that was done in the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104119&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6104119">earlier</a> paper for testing the consistency of the smoothness measure. The results from the modified SAL from this analysis is shown in the following figure.

        <p class="img-title">Fig.1. Results from the validation of the modified spectral arc length metric. These plots were obtained from the modified SAL by using an amplitude threshold of 0.05.</p>

        <p> The plot on the left shows the trend of the modified SAL as a function of the inter-submovement interval; the value of the SAL increases almost monotonically as the inter-submovement interval is decreased. This plot is similar to the one in the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104119&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6104119">earlier</a> pulication. The small kinks in this response compared to the original SAL is the result of the slight changes in the cut-off frequency estimated from the amplitude threshold to calculate the modified SAL. Increasing the amplitude threshold will make these kinks more prominent, while decreasing the amplitude threshold will make the kinks smaller.</p>

        <p> The plot on the right in the above figure shows the trend of the modified SAL with respect to the number of submovements in a movement. As the number of submovements is reduced, the smoothness increases. This plot is also similar to the one pulished <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6104119&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6104119">earlier</a>
