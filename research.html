<p>I head the <a href="http://biorehab.github.io">Biological Learning and Rehabilitation group</a>.
We are primarily interested in the development and validation of engineering tools for neurorehabilitation. We focus on both tools for movement therapy, and methods for the quantitative assessment of sensorimotor behaviour. Effective tools and methods can only result from a good understanding of the science behind healthy and stroke affected motor control and learning. Thus, we also carry out human motor control/learning studies with relevance to neurorehabilitation.</p>
