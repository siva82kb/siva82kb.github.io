<p>I head the <a href="http://biorehab.github.io">Biological Learning and Rehabilitation group</a>.</p>

<p>We are focused on developing and translating engineering tools for neurorehabilitation. We interersted in both tools for training, and methods for the quantitative assessment of movement behaviour.</p>

<p>Effective tools and methods can only result from a good understanding of the science behind healthy and stroke affected motor control and learning. Thus, we also carry out human motor control/learning studies that have relevance to neurorehabilitation.
