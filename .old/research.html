<p>My group is primarily interested is in the development and validation of tools for effective and efficient delivery of neurorehabilitation (in particular for stroke). We focus on both tools for movement therapy, and methods for the quantitative assessment of sensorimotor behaviour. Effective tools and methods can only result from a good understanding of the science behind healthy and stroke affected motor control and learning. Thus, we also carry out human motor control/learning studies with relevance to neurorehabilitation.</p>

<h3>Tools for neurorehabilitation therapy</h3>
<p class="project-title">System for Independent Task-oriented Assessment and Rehabilitation (SITAR)</p>
<p class="project-details">System for Independent Task-oriented Assessment and Rehabilitation is an instrumented multi-modal workstation for patients to training and assessment upper-extremity (UE) tasks related to activities of daily living. SITAR was originally developed by the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/human-robotics/">Human Robotics Group</a>, Imperial College London. We have recently completed a usability study with the SITAR evaluating it on patients with arm impairments. Our current work is focused on the use of SITAR for upper-extremity assessment, and its effectiveness for improving UE impairments and function.</p>

<p class="project-title">Virtual reality for vestibular rehabilitation</p>
<p class="project-details">This projects aims to develop and test the usability of a Google cardboard based head mounted display for vestibular rehabilitation of patients. This is being pursued as a MS thesis by <a href="http://www.bioe-cmcvellore.in/people/aravindnehru">Aravind</a>, in collaboration with ENT @ CMC Vellore.</p>

<p class="project-title">An intelligent system for automatic dropfoot correction with FES</p>
<p class="project-details">The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent system for drop foot correction that can be taught by the user to routinely improve its gait detection performance during steady state walking. The current study will develop the system and carry out a pilot study to evaluate its performance. This project is being pursued as a MS thesis by <a href="http://www.bioe-cmcvellore.in/people/naveeng">Naveen</a>. This project is being led by <a href="http://www.bioe-cmcvellore.in/people/surdev">Dr Suresh Devasahayam</a> from Bioengineering, and in collaboration with PMR @ CMC Vellore.</p>

<h3>Quantitative sensorimotor assessment</h3>
<p class="project-title">SPectral ARC length measure of movement smoothness</p>
<p class="project-details">We have recently developed a general method for quantifying the smoothness of different types of movement. This generalization is an extension of the novel method that we had proposed in 2012 to quantify smoothness. This new general method is suitable for use in rhythmic movements, and on movement related data other than movement kinematics. The details of the analysis to study SPARC's properties can be found <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/siva82kb/SPARC/blob/master/sparc_and_properties.ipynb"> here</a>.<br></p>

<h3>Others</h3>
<p class="project-title">Wound volume quantification of pressure ulcers</p>
<p class="project-details">To develop and validate a method for quantifying wound volume of pressure uclers using a Microsoft Kinect 2.0 (RGBD) camera. The current focus is on the algorithm development for volume quantification of objects of known geometry. This validation will be followed by collection of data from patients with pressure ulcers, and the estimation of wound volume. This work is being carried out in collaboration with Dr Blessed from Pharmacology @ CMC Vellore. This project is also an ongoing MS thesis, pursued by Ms Shilpa.</p>
